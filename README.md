# ScuffedGui about:
ScuffedGui is an Graphical User Interface for D2D1 running on External Key Input Detections.


!!This is not an Copy of ImGui that has been converted to run on D2D1 it is my own written Gui.

Functionality: Checkboxes, Buttons, Sliderfloat (working kinda for now), an Menu which can be moved around with    i for left,  u for right, O = Down, P = Up


# Test file:
In the Test file you can see an example with how you can use it in combination with D2D1. This Project was made with the Base from iraizo: https://github.com/iraizo/nvidia-overlay-hijack to hijack the overlay
