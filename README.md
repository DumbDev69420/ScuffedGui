# ScuffedGui about:
ScuffedGui is an Graphical User Interface for D2D1 running on External Key Input Detections.


!!This is not an Copy of ImGui that has been converted to run on D2D1 it is my own written Gui.

Functionality: Checkboxes, Buttons, Sliderfloat (working kinda for now), an Menu which can be moved around with    i for left,  u for right, O = Down, P = Up
