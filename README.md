# ScuffedGui about:
ScuffedGui is an Graphical User Interface for D2D1 running on External Key Input Detections.


Functionality: Checkboxes, Buttons, Sliderfloat (working kinda for now), Spacing, an Menu which can be moved around with    i for left,  u for right, O = Down, P = Up


# Test file:
In the Test file you can see an example with how you can use it in combination with D2D1. This Project was made with the Base from iraizo: https://github.com/iraizo/nvidia-overlay-hijack to hijack the overlay


# Help:
How to adept the code to your Project: Go into overlay.cpp and change the code from the Function Overlay::startup_d2d to match your D2D1 ini stuff, Rendertarget brush and so on but leave the TextFormat stuff inside the code. If this doesnt help ya open up an issue.


# Your Part:
You are welcomed to look at my code and fix stuff if you see stuff or add stuff and more functionality, stability and fix performance related stuff. Or not its your Decision :)
